# 201d56-about-me
This is an 'about me' website that contains a brief introduction about me, my education background, an overview of my job experience, and my goals.
It also has a fun game that askes the user questions about me and the user has to answer with a yes or no. 

USER EXPERIENCE:
As a user of this page. When I go to the page I get a prompt to put my name down. Which I really like. It gives the developer a chance to know who I am.
Then I am asked a series of 5 yes/no questions and I am told if I get the questions right or wrong.
The text field is also not case sensitive which allows for a good user expereince.
Then I am asked a fifth question that requires me to guess a number range.
After each guess I am told if I guessed right or if my guess was lesser or greater than the correct number. 
I am also given four tries to get the correct answer, after which the website will move on to the seventh question.
The seventh question involves me guessig again, but this time there are multiple correct answers, and I am given six tries to get the answer right.
After the seventh question, the website gives me a summary of the number of questions I got right.
After the questions I get a view of the website. Which shows me a picture of him with a brief summary, his education history,
an overview of his job experience, his goals, and top ten places he wants to visit.
